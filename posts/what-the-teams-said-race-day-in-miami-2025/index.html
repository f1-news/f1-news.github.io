I’ve been struggling a little more than usual this weekend and not felt as comfortable in the car as at previous races this season. I’ve been a little on the back foot but when it mattered, we’ve put in a good performance and come away with another strong result. Verstappen was close behind me after we pitted but I felt positive on the Medium tyre and knew I could manage my pace to keep him behind.\n“最终，迈凯兰人比该领域的其他成员都具有不错的优势。对他们的恭喜。将他们关闭将是一个艰难的要求，但是我们将继续努力，我们期待欧洲即将到来的三重头球，从伊莫拉开始。”\n基米·安东尼里（Kimi Antonelli），第六\n“不幸的是，我们今天不仅要花更多的努力，要比我们所取得的成就要多得多。我取得了一个良好的开端并运行了P2，而且迈凯兰人对我们来说的步伐太大了，我们落后于他们。在开场的比赛中，我仍然感觉很好，在比赛中，我在比赛的下半场遇到了更多的努力，而我们在比赛的下半场却不出色。我们的速度不大。我们贡献了贡献的贡献。我们的贡献是贡献了P6的贡献。看看我们可以改进的地方。\n“不过，总的来说，我对周末的表现感到满意。我们的排位赛很强，很高兴能以我的第一个冲刺杆位的位置。我仍然在比赛管理方面获得经验，而且我敢肯定，随着赛季的进展，我会继续变得更好。我现在为下一场比赛感到兴奋，因为下一场比赛是imola at imola和我的第一场大游乐，我敢肯定，我的大气层和大气层都非常不可思议。\n托托·沃尔夫（Toto Wolff），梅赛德斯 - 奔驰赛车的负责人\n“乔治今天开着一场伟大的比赛，并竭尽所能获得第三名。这是另一个成熟的表现，他把所有的一切都从那里拿出来。显然，迈凯兰人的差距很大。这令人失望，但我们正在努力提出更新，这些更新将带来那个赤字，有望结束这一赤字。我们已经看到了这些前六个赛车的赛车。\n“与此同时，基米（Kimi）展示了他的才华，但他有一场比赛，他将带走一些很好的学习。对于新秀司机来说，这是完全正常的，只有18。比赛管理将会到来，因为他继续继续他的经验，我们现在期待欧洲即将到来的三重车手。\nAndrew Shovlin，Trackside工程总监\n恭喜乔治（George）的本赛季第四个领奖。我们从虚拟安全车的部署中受益匪浅，可以跳到Verstappen，但这始终是长期跑步的局面之一。我们选择在硬质合器上启动George，以便我们可以做到这一点，并估计有50％的潮湿的机会。\n“尽管乔治从虚拟安全车中受益，但木米在出来之前就失去了停下来。我们必须把他束缚在威廉姆斯的威廉姆斯中的阿尔蒙，后者有机会部署了底线。在维特尔巷中，一些交通损失了他的速度，最终使他在艰难的轮胎上为他带来了p6的良好周末。尽管如此，他还是继续了他的发展。\n“麦克拉伦今天再次成为该领域的班级，我们正在努力缩小差距。总的来说，我们很高兴我们与红牛和红牛和法拉利相比增加了更多的积分，但是知道如果我们在每个周末要在最初的周末要挑战我们要做的工作要做。\n红牛 Verstappen在早期阶段领导，但发现自己受Piastri的压力。他一直将澳大利亚人的范围推向第一回合，但最终让自己越过烤架，让迈凯轮过去。他还为诺里斯（Norris）辩护，这两个交换场所多次，然后迈凯轮再次通过。 Verstappen查找了第三名，但在VSC提供的坑中被Russell跳了。至于Tsunoda，他因在矿井车道上超速驾驶而获得了五秒钟的罚款，并设法将脚踩在最后几圈上，以将五秒钟的差距拉到Hadjar，以确保他坚持到最后一点。\nMax Verstappen，第四\n昨天我说我会尽力而为，我尽我所能，但是那是一场挣扎。我试图打架，但最终不可能将它们留在后面。这是不可能的VSC，我们对VSC有些不幸，但是当然，这是赛车的一部分，总的来说，我们没有真正的步伐，所以我艰难地跑步了。对于我们来说，我们最终缺乏速度，每次试图接近或推动更多的时间，我的轮胎会过热。\nYuki Tsunoda，第十\n“对于我而言，我和我的旧队友当然没有任何事情使我的生活变得更加困难，这使我变得更加困难，这是不必要的，这使我的生活变得更加轻松！伊萨克（Isack）达到了很多速度，我一直在努力，我一直在努力，他一直在努力。他又一次地回来了。我很难让我感到满意，但我不得不努力，我已经做好了我的胜利，我已经做到了，我已经做到了。我认为，作为一个团队，我们的速度不仅仅是我要努力的，这是我必须在这场比赛中所能做的。\n团队校长克里斯蒂安·霍纳（Christian Horner）\n“我们今天付出了一切，但对迈克拉伦做得很好，他们处于另一个联盟中，所以P4和双分的成绩与我们经常从混乱的迈阿密GP中获得一样好。Max对他的领先优势和在开幕式上的领先地位进行坚定的防御，VSC在Max的早期停下来付出了努力的机会，并为他付出了很大的努力。要在汽车上做很多工作要做，以找到最终的比赛步伐。\n威廉姆斯 威廉姆斯（Williams）的比赛繁忙，他们的司机在整个大奖赛中多次交换了位置。最后，Albon最终取得了进步，并设法在Antonelli上取得了良好的超越，以攀升至第五。这与他本赛季的最佳成绩相符，并弥补了他在昨天的冲刺中输掉的P4。塞恩兹（Sainz）在与汉密尔顿（Hamilton）的最后一圈接触后也得分。\nAlex Albon，第五\n“我很高兴能够在昨天之后重置并再次出发！这辆车很快，今天都是关于纯粹的节奏。我对结果感到非常满意，我对结果感到非常满意。要与顶级车队作斗争，我几乎不敢相信，当您看到我们12个月前的位置时，我们已经在Grove上取得的所有进展。我要喜欢它！”\n**卡洛斯·塞恩兹（Carlos Sainz），第9 **\n“在一场令人沮丧的比赛之后不开心。昨天的操作误解使我们从一开始就陷入了后脚，因为我不得不在二手化合物上开始比赛。避免在他重新加入赛道时在第1圈避免兰多，不幸地与亚历克斯（Alex）接触，这导致了我的地板，这在剩下的情况下造成了一些不当造成的损害。我们将在两者之间进行了造成的损害。我不可避免地会失去职位。\n詹姆斯·沃尔斯（James Vowles），团队校长\n“这是一个蓬松的动荡周末，但是今天的结果让我感到非常高兴。鉴于我们昨天早上遇到的挫折，要回到排位赛的前十辆车上与两辆汽车的战斗，并且在排位赛中与两辆车结束，这是令人难以置信的有意义的。这是一个漫长的赛季。这是一个漫长的赛季，团队将带来更新，以便我们在下一席上遇到的五场比赛，但是，我们的五场比赛是五个赛车，但是五个赛车是五场比赛，但五场比赛是五个种族，五个赛车的比赛，五个种族，五个种族，五个种族，五个种族，这是五个赛车的比赛，这是五个赛车的比赛，这是五个赛车的比赛，这是五个赛车的比赛，这是五个赛车的竞赛，这是五个赛车的竞赛，而这是五个赛车的比赛。以前。\n法拉利 法拉利（Ferrari）似乎在迈阿密进入泡菜。汉密尔顿（Hamilton）从硬轮胎开始，介于媒介。汉密尔顿在VSC下爬上了赛场，并在VSC下进行了便宜的进站，然后在不同的策略中发现自己在队友的尾巴上。鉴于他处于更快的速度上，他要求让自己过去 - 但车队只有三圈后才允许。然后，汉密尔顿无法继续前进，导致Leclerc要求通过。团队再次允许，但在明显的延误之后，两位车手都感到沮丧。\n查尔斯·莱克莱克（Charles Leclerc），第七\n“对我们来说，这是一个艰难的周末。在过去的三场比赛中，我们取得了良好的进步，但是这个周末我在车上没有相同的感觉，我们需要了解原因。\n今天，我们的步伐不在第一个工作中，然后在我一开始就管理的第二个任期，之后我不得不在肮脏的空气中奔跑。我再次推进最后，但这还不够。我将继续始终付出我所拥有的一切，我们必须团队团结在一起，并努力取得更大的进步。”\n**刘易斯·汉密尔顿（Lewis Hamilton），第8 **\n“总的来说，这个周末我们已经迈出了一些稳定的步骤。当然，P8并不是我们要成为的目标，而且肯定会学会前进，但是考虑到我们从哪里开始，这是一个体面的康复。我开始对汽车感到更加对一辆，这令人鼓舞，而且我像曾经一样积极进取，在前面的战斗中，我们仍然在努力努力。专注于未来的工作。”\n弗雷德·瓦西尔（Fred Vasseur），团队校长\n“这个周末我们还没有完全保持平衡，尤其是昨天的排位赛，今天我们在小组的中间挣扎，几乎没有机会获得比这更好的结果。当我们在自由空气中，我们接近梅赛德斯和红牛就节奏而言。在像这样的比赛之后，显然需要一种沮丧的感觉，但是我们需要保持专注并继续努力工作，以解决问题，以解决问题，这是在问题上的限制。\n在策略方面，我们的电话是正确的：我们将两个驾驶员都放在虚拟安全车上，这使刘易斯能够在重新启动时在查尔斯后面奔跑。然后，我们一旦确定我们不会将Charles冒着危险，因为Lewis在中型轮胎中，我们想尝试抓住Kimi Antonelli，我们就换了汽车。它行不通，因此我们根据我们的标准程序将呼叫反转。”\n赛车公牛 劳森（Lawson）被杜汉（Doohan）在第一个角落标记为旋转，这使猕猴桃赛车手持久并损坏了他的地板。他试图继续，但由于汽车损坏，最终退休了。哈迪亚（Hadjar）在迈阿密（Miami）得分接近得分，知道前田（Tsunoda）提前罚分。他迟到了，在红牛的五秒钟之内到达，跌落了十分之一以上。\n**ISACK HADJAR，11th **\n“我对今天的开车并不感到非常满意，因为我觉得自己在这里和那里犯了一些错误，最后，我认为这是我的前十名。但是，与此同时，它表明我没有推动多少。根本没有利润。我们在进站的艰难轮胎上做了几圈。在进站之后，我在Yeuki中还很愉快，因为我在五个Yeuki中都很愉快。我可以做到的一切，但不幸的是，我们只有十分之一的时间，我很自信地前往Imola。\n**利亚姆·劳森（Liam Lawson），DNF **\n“我们有一个很好的开端。一个很大的差距张开了一回合，所以我进来了，跟随谁在我面前，然后从侧面受到打击。我们在那里遭受了巨大的伤害，一直在下雨了，但不幸的是，这真是太可惜了。这真是太可惜了。这是一个耻辱。这是一个耻辱，因为这个周末的工作很棒，而且汽车很快。我们要转移到三重的前进，并继续前进，并继续前进，并继续前进。\nLaurent Mekies，团队校长\n“迈阿密对我们来说是一个非常特殊的周末。它始于粉丝们对我们的特殊涂装的出色反应，并以快速的节奏过山车前往Isack和Liam的快节奏过山车。上周五为Isack in Sq的Isack上的前10名，然后从P14到P7为Liam争夺Liam在Sprint竞赛中赢得了一百次罚款。第二次在LAP 1上发生碰撞之后，今天只有0.1次进入Yuki的最后一点。\n哈斯 Ocon无法将他的P9网格插槽转换为迈阿密的得分，因为他输给了比赛中途康复的汉密尔顿，也被Hadjar跳了出来。 Bearman没有完成，很早就停车，听起来像PU问题。那是他本赛季的第一次退休，这是新秀的艰难周末，这是他两次获得P20的资格。\n**Esteban Ocon，12th **\n“这是我们一场扎实的比赛，但不幸的是，我们缺乏与前面更快的人打架的步伐。我们并没有很幸运，因为我们没有在VSC下进行战斗，但他们总是以同样的方式结束，所以这是有点令人沮丧的，所以我认为整体上有一个很强的周末，我们需要在一个周末待得一件事，我们会在某些周末能够获得一些良好的待遇。在某些周末待遇，这是一点点的待遇。对于即将举行的比赛，我很期待。”\n**Oliver Bearman，DNF **\n“一切顺利，但我在DRS火车上花了很多时间，这显然不是轮胎的理想选择。我认为我们有一定的步伐，但还不足以达到这一点。我们需要回顾发生的事情，我失去了驱动力，不幸的是，我们无法完成比赛。我在Sprint和Sprint上竞争的积极和表现都在Sprint和Sprint上，我们将获得竞争的效果。\nAyao Komatsu，团队校长\n“今天是一场艰难的比赛。奥利（Ollie）从P20开始，我们试图尽可能多地向前迈进，但我们失败了，这就是他的比赛结束。埃斯特万（Esteban）的第一个领先还可以 - 他在与汉密尔顿（Hamilton）的战斗非常好，并保持了他的努力，只要他不得不努力，所以我们没有得到正确的时间，所以我们没有得到正确的时间。我认为，由于Tsunoda的罚款，我们可能会有P10，这是一个令人失望的事情，但我们需要从本周末学习，有时我们确实在埃斯特班（Esteban）钉上了Q2。\n高山 Doohan的比赛并没有持续很长时间，因为他在开场圈的第一回合与Lawson接触。那使他穿刺了，他无法将其弯腰回到坑里 - 在逃生道路附近停车并带出VSC。在一夜之间进行了一些设置更改后，Gasly从矿井车道开始，但他只能在国旗上恢复到P13。\n皮埃尔·加利（Pierre Gasly），13\n“总的来说，这对我们来说是一个艰难的周末。至少在昨天的冲刺比赛之后，我们要离开迈阿密，这是出乎意料的。我们知道今天的比赛在汽车上有几个问题后会很棘手。我们试图解决今天的汽车。我们今天有点好一点了，这是更好的，但最终我们假设我们会在雨水中遇到任何机会。关于我们在这里的表现，我们在以前的比赛中一直更快，而且在这里，我们有工作要做。”\n**Jack Doohan，DNF **\n“对于我的车库侧面来说，这是一个艰难的结局。我们是从背包中部开始的，总是构成挑战到前几个角落。我们被挤进了第1弯，无处可去，我们与[Liam] Lawson接触过[Liam] Lawson。损害太多了，无法恢复过来，以至于又一次地进行了赛车，尤其是在驾驶中，我们已经既有了又有的竞争了。在整个周末的汽车中，我们的重点转向接下来的几场比赛。\n奥利弗·奥克斯（Oliver Oakes），团队校长\n“我们离开迈阿密感到失望的是，最终我们缺乏足够的竞争能力来争取积分。尽管我们没有从迈阿密空手手中脱离迈阿密，在斯普林特（Sprint）中获得了一分。皮埃尔（Pierre vsc。\n索伯 赫尔肯贝格（Hulkenberg）开始艰难的轮胎，是最后一个要进攻的人，但长期以来并没有导致对安全车的希望。当他交换为媒介时，他放下了订单，但至少看到了方格旗。 Bortoleto没有 - 他正在射击，说他的动力部队在被要求退休时遇到了问题。但是他没有进入坑，不得不在本赛季的第二个DNF上停下赛道。\n**尼科·赫尔肯伯格（Nico Hulkenberg），第14 **\n“今天这是一场非常干净的比赛，感觉就像是今年最好的比赛之一。当劳森（Lawson）和杜汉（Doohan）相撞时，我设法避免了麻烦，并努力建立一个体面的比赛节奏。与我在艰难的第一轮比赛中，我不愿意进行一段艰难的第一轮车，我们将一定的机会与我们一定的机会相比。就像我们在本周末迈出了又一步。\n**Gabriel Bortoleto，DNF **\n“这是一场不错的比赛，直到我们必须退休。我们一直在p13中稳固地奔跑，紧随ocon和gasly领先，我觉得我们可以将这个立场持续到尽头。步伐是我们的预期 - 我们在Haas和rb落后了一些，但仍然落后于Haas和RB，但仍在混合在一起。不幸的是，我完全开始了我的最终陪伴，最终的陪伴下来，这是一个大型的牛coar，这是一家人的最终陪伴。有人告诉我，这是一个影响我们的燃料系统，但我还没有时间与团队进行分析。\nMcLaren Oscar Piastri, 1st\n“It’s a great feeling to have won the race today, one I really wanted to win! Clearly the car was unbelievable today and we were able to use that pace advantage. That’s down to everyone here trackside and the whole team at the factory putting in an incredible amount of hard work to get us to where we are now. As always, there’s lots of learnings to take away from the weekend but I’m very, very happy to be leaving Miami on top.”\nLando Norris, 2nd\n“A good result for the team today and congratulations to Oscar on the victory, he drove really well this afternoon. Max [Verstappen] put up a fight at the start and frustratingly I paid the price but that’s just the way it can be in racing. The team have done an amazing job all weekend, the car has been beautiful with great pace and the double-shuffle pit stop was mega. I’ll take all these positives and get my head down at the factory to focus on Imola in two weeks’ time.”\nAndrea Stella, Team Principal\n“Today was an exceptional result for McLaren at the end of a remarkable weekend. First and second yesterday in the Sprint, followed by first and second again today in the Miami Grand Prix, which is a first for any team in a Sprint weekend. It’s a big haul of points, and we’re mindful that tomorrow is the anniversary of our first victory of this era, which was a fundamental milestone in the direction and development of our team.\n“Not for the first time this year, I would like to thank the people at McLaren who have designed, manufactured, built and are racing this phenomenal car, as well as our technical and commercial partners, and fans who are with us on this exciting journey.\n“After a very tight Qualifying session, it was great to see the car performing so well during the race, allowing Oscar and Lando to dominate. Oscar was clinical and very precise, taking the opportunities that came his way and displaying excellent pace. Lando was delayed in the mêlée at the start, recovering from sixth and then overtaking Max Verstappen later in the stint, but without this he was in strong contention for the win also.\n“This is a great foundation for the rest of the year, but we also know that maybe these were exceptional circumstances. We’ll keep our feet on the ground, keep working on the MCL39 to improve it, and see where it takes us now the racing season moves back to Europe.”\nMercedes Antonelli was running in second early on, but was powerless to hold the faster McLarens at bay. He then had a slow pit stop, which was before the VSC came out. All of that contrived to drop him behind his team mate, Russell benefitting from a cheap stop after starting on the hard tyre. He came out just ahead of Verstappen, and managed to stay in front of the Dutchman to pick up yet another podium.\nGeorge Russell, 3rd\n“I am really happy to come away with P3 today in Miami. I’ve been struggling a little more than usual this weekend and not felt as comfortable in the car as at previous races this season. I’ve been a little on the back foot but when it mattered, we’ve put in a good performance and come away with another strong result. Verstappen was close behind me after we pitted but I felt positive on the Medium tyre and knew I could manage my pace to keep him behind.\n“Ultimately the McLarens had a decent advantage over the rest of the field so congratulations to them. It will be a tough ask to close them down, but we will keep working on doing that, and we’re looking forward to the upcoming triple header in Europe, starting at Imola.”\nKimi Antonelli, 6th\n“Unfortunately, we didn’t just have the pace today to fight for much more than what we achieved. I made a good start and was running P2, but the McLarens had too much pace for us, and we dropped behind them. I still felt good on the Medium compound in the opening stint but I struggled a little more on the Hard tyre in the second half of the race. Our pace wasn’t great and that contributed to our P6 finish. We will have to analyse why that was as a team and see where we can improve.\n“Overall, though, I am pleased with how the weekend went. Our qualifying pace was strong, and it was nice to take my first Sprint pole position. I’m still gaining experience in terms of my race management, and I am sure that will continue to get better as the season progresses. I am now excited for the next race at Imola and my first ever home Grand Prix. I am sure the atmosphere and support will be incredible, so I am very much looking forward to the weekend there.”\nToto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport\n“George drove a great race today and did everything he needed to do to claim third. It was another mature performance where he got everything out of the car that was there. Obviously, the gap to the McLarens was large though. That is disappointing but we are working hard to bring updates that will hopefully close that deficit. We’ve seen these performance gaps fluctuate over these first six races, and some weekends other teams get right in the mix at the front, but they are the team to beat right now.\n“Kimi meanwhile showed his talent this weekend but had a race where he will take away some good learnings. That is completely normal for a rookie driver, and one that is just 18 years old. The race management will come as he continues to build his experience and we’re now looking forward to the upcoming triple-header in Europe. The next race will mark Kimi’s first ever home Grand Prix at Imola and I am sure he will be looking forward to that.”\nAndrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director\n“Congratulations to George on his fourth podium of the season. We benefited from the deployment of the Virtual Safety Car to jump Verstappen, but that is always one of the upsides of running long. We had opted to start George on the Hard compound so that we could do this and that decision paid off. We also estimated the chance of a wet race at about 50% but, despite a cell getting incredibly close, the rain just passed us by.\n“Whilst George benefited from the Virtual Safety Car, Kimi lost out having stopped just before it came out. We had to box him to protect from Albon in the Williams who had the chance to deploy the undercut. Some traffic in the pit lane cost him and ultimately his pace on the Hard tyre consigned him to P6. It has still been another good weekend for Kimi though as he continues his development.\n“McLaren were the class of the field once again today and we are working hard to close that gap. Overall, we leave Miami pleased we have added more points to our tally compared to Red Bull and Ferrari, but knowing we have got work to do if we are to challenge at the very front each weekend. Our single lap has been a strength, but we need to improve our long run pace. Hopefully we can make some gains in this area starting in Imola in two weeks’ time.”\nRed Bull Verstappen led in the early stages, but found himself under pressure from Piastri. He kept pushing the Australian wide into Turn 1, but in the end out-braked himself and let the McLaren past. He also defended hard against Norris, those two swapping places multiple times before again the McLaren got through. Verstappen looked on for third, but got jumped by Russell in the pits courtesy of a VSC. As for Tsunoda, he picked up a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane, and managed to put his foot down on the last few laps to pull a five-second gap to Hadjar behind to make sure he held on to the last point.\nMax Verstappen, 4th\n“Yesterday I said that I would try my very best and I gave it everything that I could, but it ended up being a struggle out there. I tried to put up a fight, but in the end it was impossible to keep them behind. We got a bit unlucky with the VSC, but of course that is part of racing and overall the pace wasn’t really there. We had nothing to lose so I was just trying to have a bit of fun on the track and it was cool to be out there racing. The race was unfortunately quite difficult for us in general and we ultimately lacked pace and struggled with the breaks. Every time that I tried to get close or push a bit more, my tyres would overheat a lot. It was really down to tyre management today and the track had quite high degradation, which is not our strong suit at the moment. We need a bit more performance to make sure we are more competitive, but we were quite far off today.”\nYuki Tsunoda, 10th\n“It was unnecessary for me to be in that position with the time penalty and it made things a lot more difficult in the race for me and my old teammate certainly did nothing to make my life easier in those last few laps! Isack picked up the pace quite a lot, I was pushing a lot and he kept coming back. It was tough to keep the five second gap but I had to do what I had to do and I maximised the pace. I am happy I was able to score points but again, not happy with the pace I had. I think, as a Team, we struggled overall with race pace, it wasn’t just me and it is something we have to look at. I did all I could in this race. I gave the maximum that I can for now, it is tough to get the car in the place we want, but we will work towards it and make up for it in the future. I am feeling more confident in the car as the weeks go by and we will unlock it.”\nChristian Horner, Team Principal\n“We gave it everything today but well done to McLaren, they were in a different league so P4 and a double points finish is as good as we could get from an often chaotic Miami GP. Max put up a staunch defence of his lead and position in the opening stint, but the VSC gave others the opportunity to capitalise on Max’s earlier stop and ultimately cost him a podium finish. P10 for Yuki who did well to hold onto his point in the end. The race showed that we still have a lot of work to do on the car to find that ultimate race pace. We’ll take our learnings back to Milton Keynes and come back with everything we have for our 400th race in Imola in a couple of weeks time.”\nWilliams Williams had a busy race, with their drivers swapping positions multiple times throughout the Grand Prix. In the end Albon ended up ahead, and managed to pull off a good overtake on Antonelli to climb to fifth. That matched his best result of the season, and made up for the P4 he lost in yesterday’s Sprint. Sainz also scored after surviving some last-lap contact with Hamilton.\nAlex Albon, 5th\n“I’m glad I could reset and go again after yesterday! The car was quick and today was all about pure pace. I had a good rhythm all race and I’m very happy with the result. To be battling with the top teams, I can hardly believe it to be honest, when you look at where we were 12 months ago. This shows all the progress we’ve made at Grove and now we’ve shown the world that we can race at the top. This won’t happen every race and we’ll definitely have to keep fighting. For now, I’m going to enjoy it!”\nCarlos Sainz, 9th\n“Not happy after a frustrating race. The operational misunderstanding of yesterday put us on the back-foot from the beginning as I had to start the race on a used compound. Avoiding Lando in Lap 1 when he rejoined the track unfortunately resulted in contact with Alex, which damaged my floor quite badly for the rest of the race. There was some miscommunication between our two sides of the garage that we will analyse internally, but to be honest, with the damage I had it was inevitable that I would end up losing positions. I did everything I could to hold on and stick with the cars ahead, but P9 was the final result. On a positive note, today we had very good pace and the balance of the car is the best it’s felt since the start of the season, so we’ll try to take the positives and review everything as a team.”\nJames Vowles, Team Principal\n“It’s been a topsy turvy weekend, but I’m really pleased for the team with the result today. Given the setbacks we had yesterday morning, to come back fighting with both cars in the top ten in Qualifying, and to finish with both cars in the points is incredibly rewarding. It’s a long season and teams will bring updates so it will be interesting to see how it all shakes out over the next few races, but to score from five of the first six races is a different world to where we’ve been previously. I couldn’t be more proud of the team and the world class drivers we have. Alex and Carlos are really giving their all to this team and we are on a good pathway moving forwards.”\nFerrari Ferrari appeared to get themselves into a pickle in Miami. Hamilton started on the hard tyre, Leclerc the medium. Hamilton climbed up through the field and had a cheap pit stop under the VSC, then found himself right on his team mate’s tail on different strategies. He asked to be let past, given he was on the faster mediums at the point - but the team only allowed it after three laps. Hamilton then could not motor on, leading to Leclerc asking to be let through. The team again allowed it but again after apparent delay, leaving both drivers a tad frustrated.\nCharles Leclerc, 7th\n“It has been a tough weekend for us. Over the last three races, we have made some good progress, but I just didn’t have that same feeling in the car this weekend and we need to understand why.\nToday, our pace wasn’t there on the first stint, then on the second stint I was managing at the start, after which I had to run in dirty air. I pushed again towards the end, but it just wasn’t enough. I will continue to always give everything I’ve got and we have to come together as a team and work on making more progress.”\nLewis Hamilton, 8th\n“Overall, we’ve made some solid steps forward this weekend. P8 isn’t where we aim to be of course, and there are definitely learnings to take moving forward, but considering where we started it was a decent recovery. I’m starting to feel more at one with the car, which is encouraging, and I’m as motivated as ever to be fighting at the front. We’re still lacking a bit of pace, but everyone is working incredibly hard behind the scenes and we’re hopeful of making progress in the coming races. We’ll just keep pushing and stay focused on the work ahead.”\nFred Vasseur, Team Principal\n“We didn’t quite get the balance right this weekend, particularly yesterday in qualifying and then today we struggled in the middle of the group with little chance to secure a better result than this. When we were in free air, we were close to Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of pace. After a race like this there’s obviously a sense of frustration, but we need to stay focused and keep working hard in order to address the issues, dealing with our limitations step by step.\nOn the strategy front, our calls were right: we pitted both our drivers under the Virtual Safety Car and this allowed Lewis to run behind Charles at the restart. Then we swapped the cars as soon as we were sure we were not putting Charles at risk from the cars behind, as Lewis was on Medium tyres and we wanted to try and catch Kimi Antonelli. It didn’t work so we reversed the call at the end as per our standard procedure.”\nRacing Bulls Lawson was tagged into a spin in the first corner by Doohan, which dropped the Kiwi racer to last and also damaged his floor. He tried to continue, but ultimately retired thanks to that car damage. Hadjar came close to scoring in Miami, knowing Tsunoda ahead had a time penalty coming. He pushed and pushed late on to get within five seconds of the Red Bull, winding up losing out by just over a tenth of a second.\nIsack Hadjar, 11th\n“I’m not really happy with my driving today as I feel like I made some mistakes here and there, and in the end, I think that cost me the top 10. At the same time, however, it shows how much I pushed. There was no margin at all. We did several laps on hard tyres after the pit stop and overall it was an enjoyable race as it was a Qualifying battle with Yuki. I knew I was still within the five second gap during the last lap as I had the gap difference live. I gave everything I could, but unfortunately it wasn’t enough. We missed a point by just one-tenth and a half. I’m feeling confident heading to Imola next; I know the track well and I also won there in F2.”\nLiam Lawson, DNF\n“We had a really good start. A big gap opened up into turn one so I went in and was following whoever was in front of me and then felt a hit from the side. We took some big damage there and was holding out for some rain, but unfortunately it never came. It’s a shame because the team have done a great job this weekend and the car has been fast. We’ll reset ahead of the triple header, keep looking forwards and keep improving things.”\nLaurent Mekies, Team Principal\n“Miami was a very special weekend for us. It started with the fantastic reaction from the fans to our special livery, and it continued on track with a fast paced rollercoaster for Isack and Liam. Top 10 on Friday for Isack in SQ, then an incredible fight from P14 to P7 for Liam in the Sprint race, before a penalty stripped him of his points. In Qualifying for the Grand Prix itself, Isack just missed the cut to Q3 by two hundredths of a second, before missing the final point today by just 0.1s to Yuki after a very strong race. Liam’s race however was ruined following a collision on lap 1. The good news is that our car and our drivers showed strong pace again this weekend even if the points didn’t come. We will keep learning and pushing as hard as we can and we can’t wait to back on track in Imola in a couple of weeks, the first of our home races this season.”\nHaas Ocon could not convert his P9 grid slot into points in Miami, as he lost out to a recovering Hamilton midway through the race, and was also jumped by Hadjar. Bearman did not finish, parking up early on with what sounded like a PU problem. That was his first retirement of the season, to cap a difficult weekend for the rookie which saw him qualify in P20 twice.\nEsteban Ocon, 12th\n“It was a solid race on our side but unfortunately, we lacked a bit of pace to be fighting with the quicker guys in front. We didn’t get very lucky as we didn’t pit under VSC, had a couple of fights but they always ended the same way, so that was a bit frustrating. I think overall it’s been a strong weekend from the team and we need to keep that going once we find a bit more performance in the car. We’ll keep at it, there are some good learnings from this weekend, and some good expectations for the upcoming races, so I’m looking forward to it.”\nOliver Bearman, DNF\n“It was going okay but I spent a good chunk of time in a DRS train, which obviously wasn’t ideal for the tyres. I think we had some pace but not enough to be in the points. We need to review what happened, I lost drive, and it’s unfortunate that we weren’t able to finish the race. I take away the positive that our pace and performance in the Sprint was competitive, and we move on to the next.”\nAyao Komatsu, Team Principal\n“Today’s been quite a tough race. With Ollie starting from P20, we tried to go forwards as much as possible but we had a PU failure, so that was the end of his race. Esteban’s first stint was okay - he was fighting against Hamilton pretty well and held him back for as long as he did, so he drove well - but we didn’t get our pit stop timing correct so we got undercut by Hadjar. That ruined it as in the second stint we couldn’t overtake him, which killed the tyres. I think because of Tsunoda’s penalty, we could’ve had P10 and that’s the really disappointing thing, but we need to learn from it. This weekend, sometimes we really nailed it; like in Q2 with Esteban, but Q1 and Q3 wasn’t great. There’s plenty of things that we need to understand, today’s race pace and decision making because the pit stop didn’t work, so we need to learn as a team and then put it right in Imola.”\nAlpine Doohan’s race did not last very long, as he made contact with Lawson in Turn 1 on the opening lap. That left him with a puncture, and he could not limp back to the pits - parking up near an escape road and bringing out a VSC. Gasly started from the pit lane after making some set-up changes overnight, but he could only recover to P13 at the flag.\nPierre Gasly, 13th\n“Overall, it has been a difficult weekend for us. At least we are leaving Miami with one point following the Sprint Race yesterday, which was a bit unexpected. We knew that today’s race was going to be tricky after having had a couple of issues on the car which we tried to fix for today. It was a little bit better but ultimately, we lacked pace. I suppose we would have liked the rain to come during the race to give us a chance to fight but it did not come in the end. We need to do some analysis on the performance we had here as we have been faster in previous races, and it has been complicated here. We have work to do between now and the next race in Imola.”\nJack Doohan, DNF\n“It was a tough end to the weekend for my side of the garage. We were starting from the middle of the pack which always creates a challenge coming into the first few corners. We were squeezed going into Turn 1 and with nowhere to go we had contact with [Liam] Lawson. The damage was too much to make it back to the pitlane safely and we ultimately had to retire the car. We showed some promise in the Sprint Race, especially in managing the difficult weather conditions, and I have felt comfortable in the car across the weekend. Our focus now shifts toward the next few races. We have the week ahead to reset and work to prepare for the upcoming triple-header as we head into the start of the European season.”\nOliver Oakes, Team Principal\n“We leave Miami disappointed where ultimately, we lacked performance to be competitive enough to fight for points. Although we did not come away from Miami empty-handed, picking up one point in the Sprint. Pierre was not happy with how the car felt in Qualifying and given his starting position we opted to make changes to his car and start from the pitlane. The forecasted rain missed the circuit, so in a conventional dry race we tried to make progress and pitted Pierre under the second VSC. Although we made up several positions ultimately it was only good enough for 13th. Jack’s race unfortunately ended on the first lap after contact with Lawson at Turn 1. We have some time now between races to understand where we can improve and come back with some more performance for the European triple-header starting in Imola.”\nKick Sauber Hulkenberg started on the hard tyre and was the last man to pit, but going long did not lead to the hoped for Safety Car. He dropped down the order when he swapped to the mediums, but did at least see the chequered flag. Bortoleto did not - he was radioing to say his power unit was suffering issues when he was called to the pits to retire. But he did not make it to the pits, having to park up off the track instead for his second DNF of the season.\nNico Hulkenberg, 14th\n“It’s been a pretty clean race today and felt like one of the better ones this year. I managed to stay out of trouble at Turn One, when Lawson and Doohan collided, and worked on building a decent race pace. In contrast to most of the other cars I was on a reverse strategy, starting with hard tyres to deliver a long first stint. We didn’t take the opportunity of the first Virtual Safety Car to make a pit stop, which is something we need to review with the team. However, it feels like we’ve taken another step forward this weekend. With a bit more performance and improved car balance, we believe we can get closer to fighting for points. With those improvements in mind, we’re now looking forward to starting the European part of the season.”\nGabriel Bortoleto, DNF\n“It was a decent race up to the point we had to retire. We were solidly running in P13, just behind Ocon and ahead of Gasly, and I felt we could’ve held that position to the end. The pace was what we expected—we were a bit behind Haas and RB but still in the mix. Unfortunately, I started losing power on the straights in, what became my final laps, then had two big cuts in the corners, and eventually the car just shut down completely. From what I’ve been told, it looks like a fuel system issue that affected us, but I haven’t had time to analyse it with the team yet. It’s a shame, especially as DNFs have been rare in my career, but that’s part of the game. We can still take quite a few positive from the weekend—our single-lap performance and the pace we had before the issue are points on which we can build. We’ll look into everything we experienced this weekend, learn from it, and come back stronger for the next one.”\nJonathan Wheatley, Team Principal\n“Today’s race saw both our drivers get off the line well and deliver strong first stints. Unfortunately, we had to retire Gabriel due to a technical issue—potentially related to the fuel system—though we’ll know more once we’ve had a proper look at the car. Nico, starting from P16, pushed hard through the field. In hindsight, we may have benefited from boxing under the Virtual Safety Car, and that’s something we’ll need to analyse carefully. Despite the setbacks, the team delivered two very clean pit stops—2.2 and 2.5 seconds—which is a real credit to the crew. A lot of hard work went into this weekend, and we’ll take the lessons forward as we prepare for the European leg of the season.”\nAston Martin It was not to be for Aston Martin after a strong start to the weekend. Neither driver had much pace, Alonso’s day made worse by a spin in the early stages of the race as he lost the rear by himself. The team split the strategies, starting Alonso on the hard and Stroll the medium but to no avail, as they propped up the field.\nFernando Alonso, 15th\n“Tough race. We didn’t have the pace the whole weekend, and we expected the race to be difficult. We faced similar challenges today that we’ve had all season and couldn’t capitalise on any chaos ahead of us. We need to get better and hopefully in Imola take a step forward.”\nLance Stroll, 16th\n“Difficult race for us today and very tricky conditions, as we expected. We just simply lack pace - we’ve been slow all season so far and today wasn’t any exception. With an uneventful race and no opportunities, it just shows how we’re not competitive and need to look at improving the car in all areas.”\nAndy Cowell, Team Principal\n“Today’s results in the Miami Grand Prix are a reminder that we are simply lacking car performance. There were very few opportunities to progress from our starting positions and the race turned out to be a comfortable one-stop race for the entire field. It was important that we scored four points with Lance yesterday in the Sprint, but under normal dry conditions we don’t have a car capable of competing for points right now. We need to continue to analyse where we can improve and work hard to be more competitive in Imola.”\nPirelli Mario Isola, Motorsport Director\n“It was a very straightforward race as far as the tyres were concerned. From the little data gathered over the weekend it had become clear that, despite bringing a trio of compounds one step softer than last year’s in order to create more strategy choices, it would probably still be a one-stop race and so it proved to be. There was very limited degradation on the C3 and the C4, in fact on the latter it was even less than expected. That explains why drivers who started on the Medium were able to extend their first stint to the halfway point of the race or even further, especially as the Virtual Safety Car made it easier for the leaders to switch to the Hard compound.\n“The low tyre degradation also contributed to the many battles, especially early on when drivers were able to push as hard as they wanted. It was a different scenario to the one we witnessed in Suzuka for example, a month ago. The track characteristics here are very different, with overtaking possibilities, and it also demonstrates how difficult it is to have everything in place to produce the great show that the fans deserve to see.”\n","wordCount":"12389","inLanguage":"zh","image":"https://f1-news.github.io/images/what-the-teams-said-race-day-in-miami-2025.jpg","datePublished":"2025-05-05T01:34:30Z","dateModified":"2025-05-05T01:34:30Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"FNS 123"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://f1-news.github.io/posts/what-the-teams-said-race-day-in-miami-2025/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"F1新聞 -

Clearly the car was unbelievable today and we were able to use that pace advantage. That&rsquo;s down to everyone here trackside and the whole team at the factory putting in an incredible amount of hard work to get us to where we are now. As always, there&rsquo;s lots of learnings to take away from the weekend but I&rsquo;m very, very happy to be leaving Miami on top.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Lando Norris, 2nd</strong></p><p>&ldquo;A good result for the team today and congratulations to Oscar on the victory, he drove really well this afternoon. Max [Verstappen] put up a fight at the start and frustratingly I paid the price but that&rsquo;s just the way it can be in racing. The team have done an amazing job all weekend, the car has been beautiful with great pace and the double-shuffle pit stop was mega. I&rsquo;ll take all these positives and get my head down at the factory to focus on Imola in two weeks&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Andrea Stella, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Today was an exceptional result for McLaren at the end of a remarkable weekend. First and second yesterday in the Sprint, followed by first and second again today in the Miami Grand Prix, which is a first for any team in a Sprint weekend. It&rsquo;s a big haul of points, and we&rsquo;re mindful that tomorrow is the anniversary of our first victory of this era, which was a fundamental milestone in the direction and development of our team.</p><p>&ldquo;Not for the first time this year, I would like to thank the people at McLaren who have designed, manufactured, built and are racing this phenomenal car, as well as our technical and commercial partners, and fans who are with us on this exciting journey.</p><p>&ldquo;After a very tight Qualifying session, it was great to see the car performing so well during the race, allowing Oscar and Lando to dominate. Oscar was clinical and very precise, taking the opportunities that came his way and displaying excellent pace. Lando was delayed in the mêlée at the start, recovering from sixth and then overtaking Max Verstappen later in the stint, but without this he was in strong contention for the win also.</p><p>&ldquo;This is a great foundation for the rest of the year, but we also know that maybe these were exceptional circumstances. We&rsquo;ll keep our feet on the ground, keep working on the MCL39 to improve it, and see where it takes us now the racing season moves back to Europe.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=mercedes>Mercedes<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mercedes>#</a></h3><p>Antonelli was running in second early on, but was powerless to hold the faster McLarens at bay. He then had a slow pit stop, which was before the VSC came out. All of that contrived to drop him behind his team mate, Russell benefitting from a cheap stop after starting on the hard tyre. He came out just ahead of Verstappen, and managed to stay in front of the Dutchman to pick up yet another podium.</p><p><strong>George Russell, 3rd</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I am really happy to come away with P3 today in Miami. I&rsquo;ve been struggling a little more than usual this weekend and not felt as comfortable in the car as at previous races this season. I&rsquo;ve been a little on the back foot but when it mattered, we&rsquo;ve put in a good performance and come away with another strong result. Verstappen was close behind me after we pitted but I felt positive on the Medium tyre and knew I could manage my pace to keep him behind.</p><p>&ldquo;Ultimately the McLarens had a decent advantage over the rest of the field so congratulations to them. It will be a tough ask to close them down, but we will keep working on doing that, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to the upcoming triple header in Europe, starting at Imola.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Kimi Antonelli, 6th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t just have the pace today to fight for much more than what we achieved. I made a good start and was running P2, but the McLarens had too much pace for us, and we dropped behind them. I still felt good on the Medium compound in the opening stint but I struggled a little more on the Hard tyre in the second half of the race. Our pace wasn&rsquo;t great and that contributed to our P6 finish. We will have to analyse why that was as a team and see where we can improve.</p><p>&ldquo;Overall, though, I am pleased with how the weekend went. Our qualifying pace was strong, and it was nice to take my first Sprint pole position. I&rsquo;m still gaining experience in terms of my race management, and I am sure that will continue to get better as the season progresses. I am now excited for the next race at Imola and my first ever home Grand Prix. I am sure the atmosphere and support will be incredible, so I am very much looking forward to the weekend there.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport</strong></p><p>&ldquo;George drove a great race today and did everything he needed to do to claim third. It was another mature performance where he got everything out of the car that was there. Obviously, the gap to the McLarens was large though. That is disappointing but we are working hard to bring updates that will hopefully close that deficit. We&rsquo;ve seen these performance gaps fluctuate over these first six races, and some weekends other teams get right in the mix at the front, but they are the team to beat right now.</p><p>&ldquo;Kimi meanwhile showed his talent this weekend but had a race where he will take away some good learnings. That is completely normal for a rookie driver, and one that is just 18 years old. The race management will come as he continues to build his experience and we&rsquo;re now looking forward to the upcoming triple-header in Europe. The next race will mark Kimi&rsquo;s first ever home Grand Prix at Imola and I am sure he will be looking forward to that.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Congratulations to George on his fourth podium of the season. We benefited from the deployment of the Virtual Safety Car to jump Verstappen, but that is always one of the upsides of running long. We had opted to start George on the Hard compound so that we could do this and that decision paid off. We also estimated the chance of a wet race at about 50% but, despite a cell getting incredibly close, the rain just passed us by.</p><p>&ldquo;Whilst George benefited from the Virtual Safety Car, Kimi lost out having stopped just before it came out. We had to box him to protect from Albon in the Williams who had the chance to deploy the undercut. Some traffic in the pit lane cost him and ultimately his pace on the Hard tyre consigned him to P6. It has still been another good weekend for Kimi though as he continues his development.</p><p>&ldquo;McLaren were the class of the field once again today and we are working hard to close that gap. Overall, we leave Miami pleased we have added more points to our tally compared to Red Bull and Ferrari, but knowing we have got work to do if we are to challenge at the very front each weekend. Our single lap has been a strength, but we need to improve our long run pace. Hopefully we can make some gains in this area starting in Imola in two weeks&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=red-bull>Red Bull<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#red-bull>#</a></h3><p>Verstappen led in the early stages, but found himself under pressure from Piastri. He kept pushing the Australian wide into Turn 1, but in the end out-braked himself and let the McLaren past. He also defended hard against Norris, those two swapping places multiple times before again the McLaren got through. Verstappen looked on for third, but got jumped by Russell in the pits courtesy of a VSC. As for Tsunoda, he picked up a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane, and managed to put his foot down on the last few laps to pull a five-second gap to Hadjar behind to make sure he held on to the last point.</p><p><strong>Max Verstappen, 4th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Yesterday I said that I would try my very best and I gave it everything that I could, but it ended up being a struggle out there. I tried to put up a fight, but in the end it was impossible to keep them behind. We got a bit unlucky with the VSC, but of course that is part of racing and overall the pace wasn&rsquo;t really there. We had nothing to lose so I was just trying to have a bit of fun on the track and it was cool to be out there racing. The race was unfortunately quite difficult for us in general and we ultimately lacked pace and struggled with the breaks. Every time that I tried to get close or push a bit more, my tyres would overheat a lot. It was really down to tyre management today and the track had quite high degradation, which is not our strong suit at the moment. We need a bit more performance to make sure we are more competitive, but we were quite far off today.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Yuki Tsunoda, 10th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was unnecessary for me to be in that position with the time penalty and it made things a lot more difficult in the race for me and my old teammate certainly did nothing to make my life easier in those last few laps! Isack picked up the pace quite a lot, I was pushing a lot and he kept coming back. It was tough to keep the five second gap but I had to do what I had to do and I maximised the pace. I am happy I was able to score points but again, not happy with the pace I had. I think, as a Team, we struggled overall with race pace, it wasn&rsquo;t just me and it is something we have to look at. I did all I could in this race. I gave the maximum that I can for now, it is tough to get the car in the place we want, but we will work towards it and make up for it in the future. I am feeling more confident in the car as the weeks go by and we will unlock it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Christian Horner, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We gave it everything today but well done to McLaren, they were in a different league so P4 and a double points finish is as good as we could get from an often chaotic Miami GP. Max put up a staunch defence of his lead and position in the opening stint, but the VSC gave others the opportunity to capitalise on Max&rsquo;s earlier stop and ultimately cost him a podium finish. P10 for Yuki who did well to hold onto his point in the end. The race showed that we still have a lot of work to do on the car to find that ultimate race pace. We&rsquo;ll take our learnings back to Milton Keynes and come back with everything we have for our 400th race in Imola in a couple of weeks time.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=williams>Williams<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#williams>#</a></h3><p>Williams had a busy race, with their drivers swapping positions multiple times throughout the Grand Prix. In the end Albon ended up ahead, and managed to pull off a good overtake on Antonelli to climb to fifth. That matched his best result of the season, and made up for the P4 he lost in yesterday&rsquo;s Sprint. Sainz also scored after surviving some last-lap contact with Hamilton.</p><p><strong>Alex Albon, 5th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I could reset and go again after yesterday! The car was quick and today was all about pure pace. I had a good rhythm all race and I&rsquo;m very happy with the result. To be battling with the top teams, I can hardly believe it to be honest, when you look at where we were 12 months ago. This shows all the progress we&rsquo;ve made at Grove and now we&rsquo;ve shown the world that we can race at the top. This won&rsquo;t happen every race and we&rsquo;ll definitely have to keep fighting. For now, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy it!&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Carlos Sainz, 9th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Not happy after a frustrating race. The operational misunderstanding of yesterday put us on the back-foot from the beginning as I had to start the race on a used compound. Avoiding Lando in Lap 1 when he rejoined the track unfortunately resulted in contact with Alex, which damaged my floor quite badly for the rest of the race. There was some miscommunication between our two sides of the garage that we will analyse internally, but to be honest, with the damage I had it was inevitable that I would end up losing positions. I did everything I could to hold on and stick with the cars ahead, but P9 was the final result. On a positive note, today we had very good pace and the balance of the car is the best it&rsquo;s felt since the start of the season, so we&rsquo;ll try to take the positives and review everything as a team.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>James Vowles, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a topsy turvy weekend, but I&rsquo;m really pleased for the team with the result today. Given the setbacks we had yesterday morning, to come back fighting with both cars in the top ten in Qualifying, and to finish with both cars in the points is incredibly rewarding. It&rsquo;s a long season and teams will bring updates so it will be interesting to see how it all shakes out over the next few races, but to score from five of the first six races is a different world to where we&rsquo;ve been previously. I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of the team and the world class drivers we have. Alex and Carlos are really giving their all to this team and we are on a good pathway moving forwards.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=ferrari>Ferrari<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ferrari>#</a></h3><p>Ferrari appeared to get themselves into a pickle in Miami. Hamilton started on the hard tyre, Leclerc the medium. Hamilton climbed up through the field and had a cheap pit stop under the VSC, then found himself right on his team mate&rsquo;s tail on different strategies. He asked to be let past, given he was on the faster mediums at the point - but the team only allowed it after three laps. Hamilton then could not motor on, leading to Leclerc asking to be let through. The team again allowed it but again after apparent delay, leaving both drivers a tad frustrated.</p><p><strong>Charles Leclerc, 7th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It has been a tough weekend for us. Over the last three races, we have made some good progress, but I just didn&rsquo;t have that same feeling in the car this weekend and we need to understand why.</p><p>Today, our pace wasn&rsquo;t there on the first stint, then on the second stint I was managing at the start, after which I had to run in dirty air. I pushed again towards the end, but it just wasn&rsquo;t enough. I will continue to always give everything I&rsquo;ve got and we have to come together as a team and work on making more progress.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Lewis Hamilton, 8th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Overall, we&rsquo;ve made some solid steps forward this weekend. P8 isn&rsquo;t where we aim to be of course, and there are definitely learnings to take moving forward, but considering where we started it was a decent recovery. I&rsquo;m starting to feel more at one with the car, which is encouraging, and I&rsquo;m as motivated as ever to be fighting at the front. We&rsquo;re still lacking a bit of pace, but everyone is working incredibly hard behind the scenes and we&rsquo;re hopeful of making progress in the coming races. We&rsquo;ll just keep pushing and stay focused on the work ahead.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Fred Vasseur, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t quite get the balance right this weekend, particularly yesterday in qualifying and then today we struggled in the middle of the group with little chance to secure a better result than this. When we were in free air, we were close to Mercedes and Red Bull in terms of pace. After a race like this there&rsquo;s obviously a sense of frustration, but we need to stay focused and keep working hard in order to address the issues, dealing with our limitations step by step.</p><p>On the strategy front, our calls were right: we pitted both our drivers under the Virtual Safety Car and this allowed Lewis to run behind Charles at the restart. Then we swapped the cars as soon as we were sure we were not putting Charles at risk from the cars behind, as Lewis was on Medium tyres and we wanted to try and catch Kimi Antonelli. It didn&rsquo;t work so we reversed the call at the end as per our standard procedure.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=racing-bulls>Racing Bulls<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#racing-bulls>#</a></h3><p>Lawson was tagged into a spin in the first corner by Doohan, which dropped the Kiwi racer to last and also damaged his floor. He tried to continue, but ultimately retired thanks to that car damage. Hadjar came close to scoring in Miami, knowing Tsunoda ahead had a time penalty coming. He pushed and pushed late on to get within five seconds of the Red Bull, winding up losing out by just over a tenth of a second.</p><p><strong>Isack Hadjar, 11th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really happy with my driving today as I feel like I made some mistakes here and there, and in the end, I think that cost me the top 10. At the same time, however, it shows how much I pushed. There was no margin at all. We did several laps on hard tyres after the pit stop and overall it was an enjoyable race as it was a Qualifying battle with Yuki. I knew I was still within the five second gap during the last lap as I had the gap difference live. I gave everything I could, but unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t enough. We missed a point by just one-tenth and a half. I&rsquo;m feeling confident heading to Imola next; I know the track well and I also won there in F2.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Liam Lawson, DNF</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We had a really good start. A big gap opened up into turn one so I went in and was following whoever was in front of me and then felt a hit from the side. We took some big damage there and was holding out for some rain, but unfortunately it never came. It&rsquo;s a shame because the team have done a great job this weekend and the car has been fast. We&rsquo;ll reset ahead of the triple header, keep looking forwards and keep improving things.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Laurent Mekies, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Miami was a very special weekend for us. It started with the fantastic reaction from the fans to our special livery, and it continued on track with a fast paced rollercoaster for Isack and Liam. Top 10 on Friday for Isack in SQ, then an incredible fight from P14 to P7 for Liam in the Sprint race, before a penalty stripped him of his points. In Qualifying for the Grand Prix itself, Isack just missed the cut to Q3 by two hundredths of a second, before missing the final point today by just 0.1s to Yuki after a very strong race. Liam&rsquo;s race however was ruined following a collision on lap 1. The good news is that our car and our drivers showed strong pace again this weekend even if the points didn&rsquo;t come. We will keep learning and pushing as hard as we can and we can&rsquo;t wait to back on track in Imola in a couple of weeks, the first of our home races this season.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=haas>Haas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#haas>#</a></h3><p>Ocon could not convert his P9 grid slot into points in Miami, as he lost out to a recovering Hamilton midway through the race, and was also jumped by Hadjar. Bearman did not finish, parking up early on with what sounded like a PU problem. That was his first retirement of the season, to cap a difficult weekend for the rookie which saw him qualify in P20 twice.</p><p><strong>Esteban Ocon, 12th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was a solid race on our side but unfortunately, we lacked a bit of pace to be fighting with the quicker guys in front. We didn&rsquo;t get very lucky as we didn&rsquo;t pit under VSC, had a couple of fights but they always ended the same way, so that was a bit frustrating. I think overall it&rsquo;s been a strong weekend from the team and we need to keep that going once we find a bit more performance in the car. We&rsquo;ll keep at it, there are some good learnings from this weekend, and some good expectations for the upcoming races, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Oliver Bearman, DNF</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was going okay but I spent a good chunk of time in a DRS train, which obviously wasn&rsquo;t ideal for the tyres. I think we had some pace but not enough to be in the points. We need to review what happened, I lost drive, and it&rsquo;s unfortunate that we weren&rsquo;t able to finish the race. I take away the positive that our pace and performance in the Sprint was competitive, and we move on to the next.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s been quite a tough race. With Ollie starting from P20, we tried to go forwards as much as possible but we had a PU failure, so that was the end of his race. Esteban&rsquo;s first stint was okay - he was fighting against Hamilton pretty well and held him back for as long as he did, so he drove well - but we didn&rsquo;t get our pit stop timing correct so we got undercut by Hadjar. That ruined it as in the second stint we couldn&rsquo;t overtake him, which killed the tyres. I think because of Tsunoda&rsquo;s penalty, we could&rsquo;ve had P10 and that&rsquo;s the really disappointing thing, but we need to learn from it. This weekend, sometimes we really nailed it; like in Q2 with Esteban, but Q1 and Q3 wasn&rsquo;t great. There&rsquo;s plenty of things that we need to understand, today&rsquo;s race pace and decision making because the pit stop didn&rsquo;t work, so we need to learn as a team and then put it right in Imola.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=alpine>Alpine<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alpine>#</a></h3><p>Doohan&rsquo;s race did not last very long, as he made contact with Lawson in Turn 1 on the opening lap. That left him with a puncture, and he could not limp back to the pits - parking up near an escape road and bringing out a VSC. Gasly started from the pit lane after making some set-up changes overnight, but he could only recover to P13 at the flag.</p><p><strong>Pierre Gasly, 13th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Overall, it has been a difficult weekend for us. At least we are leaving Miami with one point following the Sprint Race yesterday, which was a bit unexpected. We knew that today&rsquo;s race was going to be tricky after having had a couple of issues on the car which we tried to fix for today. It was a little bit better but ultimately, we lacked pace. I suppose we would have liked the rain to come during the race to give us a chance to fight but it did not come in the end. We need to do some analysis on the performance we had here as we have been faster in previous races, and it has been complicated here. We have work to do between now and the next race in Imola.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Jack Doohan, DNF</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was a tough end to the weekend for my side of the garage. We were starting from the middle of the pack which always creates a challenge coming into the first few corners. We were squeezed going into Turn 1 and with nowhere to go we had contact with [Liam] Lawson. The damage was too much to make it back to the pitlane safely and we ultimately had to retire the car. We showed some promise in the Sprint Race, especially in managing the difficult weather conditions, and I have felt comfortable in the car across the weekend. Our focus now shifts toward the next few races. We have the week ahead to reset and work to prepare for the upcoming triple-header as we head into the start of the European season.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Oliver Oakes, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;We leave Miami disappointed where ultimately, we lacked performance to be competitive enough to fight for points. Although we did not come away from Miami empty-handed, picking up one point in the Sprint. Pierre was not happy with how the car felt in Qualifying and given his starting position we opted to make changes to his car and start from the pitlane. The forecasted rain missed the circuit, so in a conventional dry race we tried to make progress and pitted Pierre under the second VSC. Although we made up several positions ultimately it was only good enough for 13th. Jack&rsquo;s race unfortunately ended on the first lap after contact with Lawson at Turn 1. We have some time now between races to understand where we can improve and come back with some more performance for the European triple-header starting in Imola.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=kick-sauber>Kick Sauber<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#kick-sauber>#</a></h3><p>Hulkenberg started on the hard tyre and was the last man to pit, but going long did not lead to the hoped for Safety Car. He dropped down the order when he swapped to the mediums, but did at least see the chequered flag. Bortoleto did not - he was radioing to say his power unit was suffering issues when he was called to the pits to retire. But he did not make it to the pits, having to park up off the track instead for his second DNF of the season.</p><p><strong>Nico Hulkenberg, 14th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a pretty clean race today and felt like one of the better ones this year. I managed to stay out of trouble at Turn One, when Lawson and Doohan collided, and worked on building a decent race pace. In contrast to most of the other cars I was on a reverse strategy, starting with hard tyres to deliver a long first stint. We didn&rsquo;t take the opportunity of the first Virtual Safety Car to make a pit stop, which is something we need to review with the team. However, it feels like we&rsquo;ve taken another step forward this weekend. With a bit more performance and improved car balance, we believe we can get closer to fighting for points. With those improvements in mind, we&rsquo;re now looking forward to starting the European part of the season.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Gabriel Bortoleto, DNF</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was a decent race up to the point we had to retire. We were solidly running in P13, just behind Ocon and ahead of Gasly, and I felt we could&rsquo;ve held that position to the end. The pace was what we expected—we were a bit behind Haas and RB but still in the mix. Unfortunately, I started losing power on the straights in, what became my final laps, then had two big cuts in the corners, and eventually the car just shut down completely. From what I&rsquo;ve been told, it looks like a fuel system issue that affected us, but I haven&rsquo;t had time to analyse it with the team yet. It&rsquo;s a shame, especially as DNFs have been rare in my career, but that&rsquo;s part of the game. We can still take quite a few positive from the weekend—our single-lap performance and the pace we had before the issue are points on which we can build. We&rsquo;ll look into everything we experienced this weekend, learn from it, and come back stronger for the next one.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s race saw both our drivers get off the line well and deliver strong first stints. Unfortunately, we had to retire Gabriel due to a technical issue—potentially related to the fuel system—though we&rsquo;ll know more once we&rsquo;ve had a proper look at the car. Nico, starting from P16, pushed hard through the field. In hindsight, we may have benefited from boxing under the Virtual Safety Car, and that&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll need to analyse carefully. Despite the setbacks, the team delivered two very clean pit stops—2.2 and 2.5 seconds—which is a real credit to the crew. A lot of hard work went into this weekend, and we&rsquo;ll take the lessons forward as we prepare for the European leg of the season.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=aston-martin>Aston Martin<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#aston-martin>#</a></h3><p>It was not to be for Aston Martin after a strong start to the weekend. Neither driver had much pace, Alonso&rsquo;s day made worse by a spin in the early stages of the race as he lost the rear by himself. The team split the strategies, starting Alonso on the hard and Stroll the medium but to no avail, as they propped up the field.</p><p><strong>Fernando Alonso, 15th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Tough race. We didn&rsquo;t have the pace the whole weekend, and we expected the race to be difficult. We faced similar challenges today that we&rsquo;ve had all season and couldn&rsquo;t capitalise on any chaos ahead of us. We need to get better and hopefully in Imola take a step forward.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Lance Stroll, 16th</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Difficult race for us today and very tricky conditions, as we expected. We just simply lack pace - we&rsquo;ve been slow all season so far and today wasn&rsquo;t any exception. With an uneventful race and no opportunities, it just shows how we&rsquo;re not competitive and need to look at improving the car in all areas.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Andy Cowell, Team Principal</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s results in the Miami Grand Prix are a reminder that we are simply lacking car performance. There were very few opportunities to progress from our starting positions and the race turned out to be a comfortable one-stop race for the entire field. It was important that we scored four points with Lance yesterday in the Sprint, but under normal dry conditions we don&rsquo;t have a car capable of competing for points right now. We need to continue to analyse where we can improve and work hard to be more competitive in Imola.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=pirelli>Pirelli<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pirelli>#</a></h3><p><strong>Mario Isola, Motorsport Director</strong></p><p>&ldquo;It was a very straightforward race as far as the tyres were concerned. From the little data gathered over the weekend it had become clear that, despite bringing a trio of compounds one step softer than last year&rsquo;s in order to create more strategy choices, it would probably still be a one-stop race and so it proved to be. There was very limited degradation on the C3 and the C4, in fact on the latter it was even less than expected. That explains why drivers who started on the Medium were able to extend their first stint to the halfway point of the race or even further, especially as the Virtual Safety Car made it easier for the leaders to switch to the Hard compound.</p><p>&ldquo;The low tyre degradation also contributed to the many battles, especially early on when drivers were able to push as hard as they wanted. It was a different scenario to the one we witnessed in Suzuka for example, a month ago. The track characteristics here are very different, with overtaking possibilities, and it also demonstrates how difficult it is to have everything in place to produce the great show that the fans deserve to see.&rdquo;</p></div><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></div><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://twitter.com/f1_relation target=_blank>F1新聞 - FNS 123</a> All rights reserved.</span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
